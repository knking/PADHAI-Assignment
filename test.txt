Beat up on the streets, picked from the trash.

He needed some bandaid but was too low on cash.

He wanted to laugh, but went hush to avoid any clash,

Though there was a fire in his heart like a phoenix rising from the ash.



He trembled his way back home alone

Humming this disastrous melancholic tune

Until he stumbled upon a rolling stone

And fell into the dark pit of unknown.



To cage a bird with fluorescent wings,

Isn't worth a try.

It might hurt your feelings,

But let the neon birds fly.
